  <h2 class="blog__title">A Good Neighbor is a Priceless Treasure</h2>
  <p class="blog__meta">Jeff Graley // Nov 21, </p>
  <p>With Thanksgiving rapidly approaching, we at Mile Two have plenty to be thankful for. In our first full year we have been through tons of change and countless challenges associated with getting a new business off the ground. We have moved offices twice, hired 8 amazing team members, and had the honor of working with our customers to create new possibilities through technology.</p>

<p>In the spirit of thankfulness, the team at Mile Two donated $1000 in turkeys to our neighbor, The Good Neighbor House, to help provide a full Thanksgiving dinner to others in the community.</p>

<p>As the holiday season kicks off this week, Mile Two is thankful for the opportunity to contribute innovative solutions to our customerâ€™s problems. We are thankful for the team we have built. We are thankful for all of our family and friends that have supported us along the way. And last but not least we are thankful for the opportunity to lend a hand to our neighbors in the community!</p>
